## Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how Snake: Retro Classic handles information when you use our mobile game. This policy applies to all users of the Game.

Your privacy is important to us. This Game is designed to be a simple, offline Snake game that collects minimal information and stores all data locally on your device.

## Information We Collect

### Information You Provide Directly
- **Player Name (Optional):** When you achieve a high score, you may choose to enter your name (up to 15 characters) to save with your score. This is completely optional - you can also save scores anonymously.

### Information Automatically Collected
The Game automatically stores the following information locally on your device:
- **Game Scores:** Your game scores and the dates they were achieved
- **Game Statistics:** Number of games played on different difficulty levels
- **Game Settings:** Your preferences for sound effects, haptic feedback (vibration), and game speed
- **High Score Records:** Your personal best scores for tracking progress

### Information We Do NOT Collect
- We do not collect personal information such as your real name, email address, or contact information (unless you voluntarily provide a player name)
- We do not access your device's camera, microphone, contacts, photos, or location
- We do not collect device identifiers or advertising IDs
- We do not track your behavior or usage patterns
- We do not collect any biometric data
- We do not collect any personal data

## How We Use Information

The limited information collected is used solely to:
- **Enhance Gaming Experience:** Save your progress, high scores, and game statistics
- **Maintain Game Settings:** Remember your preferences for sound, vibration, and difficulty
- **Local Leaderboards:** Display your personal best scores and player names (if provided)

All data processing occurs entirely on your device. We do not transmit, upload, or share any of your information with external servers or third parties.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

**We do not share, sell, rent, or disclose any of your information to third parties.** All data remains stored locally on your device and is never transmitted outside of your device.

The Game does not connect to the internet and does not communicate with any external servers, analytics services, or advertising networks.

## Data Storage and Security

- **Local Storage Only:** All game data is stored exclusively on your device using iOS's standard UserDefaults system
- **No Cloud Backup:** Game data is not automatically backed up to iCloud or any other cloud service
- **Device Security:** Data security depends on your device's built-in iOS security features
- **Data Isolation:** Game data cannot be accessed by other apps on your device

## Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)

While this Game is not specifically designed for children under 13, we recognize that children may play our game. We are committed to protecting children's privacy:

- **No Data Collection from Children:** We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13
- **Parental Control:** Parents can delete all game data by deleting and reinstalling the app
- **Safe Gaming:** The game contains no social features, chat functions, or external links
- **No Advertising:** The game contains no advertisements or in-app purchases

If you are a parent and believe your child has provided personal information, please contact us at xberkakbay@outlook.com, and we will help you delete any such information.

## Your Privacy Rights

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have complete control:

- **Access:** View your scores and settings within the game

- **Portability:** Game data remains on your device and is not transferred to our servers

### For EU Users (GDPR)
If you are in the European Union, you have additional rights. However, since we do not collect or store personal data on our servers, most GDPR requests can be fulfilled by managing your local game data directly on your device.

### For California Users (CCPA)
California residents have specific privacy rights. Since we do not collect, sell, or share personal information, and all data remains on your device, most CCPA protections are inherently provided by our privacy-by-design approach.
